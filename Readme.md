# Next generation Peertube Addon for Kodi Mediacenter

This is an addon for [Kodi](http://kodi.tv) mediacenter to play and browse Peertube servers, channels and files.

An installable .zip can be downloaded from releases tab.
Do **not** try to install a .zip generated by GitHub. You need the plugin folder in the zip file (plugin.video.pt) for it to work. Otherwise Kodi will tell you the file structure is wrong and the install will fail.

**Note**: This plugin is very early in development so please be patient.

**Warning**: This app is only compatible with python3 and modern kodi variants. for the older kodi variants, please use the official peertube plugin by framasoft.
